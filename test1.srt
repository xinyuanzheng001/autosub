1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:01,280
Change your posture

2
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:03,072
For 2 minutes

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,120
Before I give it away

4
00:00:05,376 --> 00:00:10,240
I want to ask you to right now do a little audit of your body and what you're doing with your body

5
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:12,544
So how many viewers making yourself

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,080
Smaller major hunching

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,456
Can your legs may be wrapping your ankle sometimes we hold on to our arms like this

8
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:24,064
Sometimes we are spread out

9
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:25,600
ICU

10
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:31,488
I want you to pay attention to that in a few minutes

11
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:36,352
It could significantly

12
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:41,984
So we're really fast

13
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:44,800
And we're particularly interested

14
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:46,336
In other people's body

15
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:48,384
You're interested in

16
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,320
An awkward interaction or a smile or contemptuous

17
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Lancer naevia a very awkward wink

18
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:02,208
Or maybe even something like a handshake

19
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:09,120
Policeman gets to shake hands with the president

20
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:09,888
United

21
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:12,192
Who becomes the prime minister
