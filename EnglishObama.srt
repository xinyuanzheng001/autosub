1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:07,168
April 20th through deep water Horizon drilling rig

2
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:09,728
About 40 miles off the coast of Louisiana

3
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:12,544
11 workers lost their life

4
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:15,104
17 others were injured

5
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:19,200
And soon nearly a mile beneath the surface of the ocean

6
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:21,248
Oil began spewing into the water

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,624
Already this oil spill is the worst environmental disaster America has ever faced

8
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:29,696
And I'm like an earthquake or hurricane

9
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:34,304
It's not a single event that doesn't damage in a matter of minutes for days

10
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:39,936
The millions of gallons of oil spilled into the Gulf of Mexico an epidemic

11
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:42,752
One that we will be fighting for months

12
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:43,776
And even years

13
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,336
But make no mistake

14
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:48,640
We will fight this

15
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:52,480
Spell with everything we've got for as long as it takes

16
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:57,088
We will make BP pay for the damage their company has caught

17
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,648
And we will do whatever is necessary

18
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:04,000
To help the Gulf Coast and its people recover from this tragedy

19
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:10,656
We have known the days of cheap and easily accessible oil or number

20
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:17,312
We talked and talked about the need to an American Century long addiction to fossil fuel

21
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:23,712
And for decades we have failed to act with a sense of urgency that this challenge requires

22
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,504
Time and again

23
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,296
The path forward has been blocked

24
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:32,160
Not only oil industry lobbyist but also by a lack of political courage

25
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:32,928
And Camera

26
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:37,536
The consequences of our inaction or Not In Plain Sight

27
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:43,936
Countries like China or investing in clean energy jobs in America

28
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:49,056
Each day we spend nearly 1 billion dollars of our wealth to foreign countries

29
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,080
For there or

30
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:53,152
Today is we look to the Gulf

31
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:56,736
We see an entire way of life being threatened by a medicine cloud of

32
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:57,760
Black fruit

33
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:02,112
We cannot consign our children to this future

34
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:05,184
The tragedy unfolding on our Coast

35
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:11,584
Is the most painful and Powerful reminder yet that the time to embrace

36
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:17,728
Now is the moment for this generation National mission

37
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:21,568
To unleash America's Innovation and seize control of our own destiny

38
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,432
Each of us has a part to play in a new future that will benefit all of us

39
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,992
We recover from this recession

40
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:34,880
The transition to clean energy has the potential to grow our economy and create millions of jobs

41
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:38,976
But only if we accelerate that Transit

42
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,536
Only if we seize the moment

43
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,632
And only if we rally together and act as one nation

44
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,960
Workers and entrepreneurs scientist

45
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:49,984
And citizens

46
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:52,544
The public and private sectors

47
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:55,616
Approach I will not accept

48
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:56,640
Is an action

49
00:02:57,408 --> 00:03:03,552
Sure I will not settle for is the idea that this challenged is somehow too big and too difficult to me

50
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:10,208
You know the same thing was said about our ability to produce enough planes and tanks in World War II

51
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:17,376
The same thing was said about our ability to harness the Science and Technology

52
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,448
And yet time and again

53
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:25,056
We have refused to settle for the paltry limits of conventional wisdom

54
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:31,200
Instead what has defined it as a nation since our founding is the capacity

55
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:35,808
Our determination to fight for the America we were children

56
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,600
The oil spill

57
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:40,416
Is not the last crisis America will face

58
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:45,024
This nation is known hard times before and we will surely know them again

59
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,328
What season through

60
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,632
What has always seen us through

61
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,168
Is our strength

62
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,704
How resilience

63
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:56,544
And our unyielding faith that something better awaits us

64
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:59,104
If we summon the courage to reach for it
